## Project Overview

Smartwatches have revolutionized how individuals monitor their fitness and health. This project aims to analyze smartwatch fitness data to uncover insights into user activity levels, calorie burn, and health metrics. By leveraging Python for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and predictive modeling, the project seeks to answer business-critical questions and validate hypotheses related to fitness behaviors and product usage.

Key Challenges:

- Handling large and potentially messy datasets.
- Identifying meaningful patterns from varied activity levels.
- Building predictive models that accurately estimate health metrics like calorie burn and step count.

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/smartwatch-analysis.git  

2. Navigate to the project directory:
bash
Copy code
cd smartwatch-analysis  

3. Set up a Python virtual environment:
bash
Copy code
python -m venv env  
source env/bin/activate  # or env\Scripts\activate on Windows  

4. Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
